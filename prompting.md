# Prompt Engineering

## Introduction

AI helps us a lot, they are very useful and it requires a skill to use them effectively. In this file we will explore the way of prompt engineering. There are some steps before we prompt AI to code. We use strategy to gain effectively AI coding.

1. Teach AI the project. AI should know the project overview and its structure. We extensively document that and that will attached to all prompts.
2. Analyze Steps Required for the Task. AI should analyze what steps are required for the coming task. We create product requirements document (PRD) to help AI understand the project.
3. Then we can prompt AI to code.
4. Test and checks the code generated by AI. This is a crucial step to ensure the quality and functionality of the code. We can use Git to manage the codebase and track changes.
5. Finally, we are satisfied and we ask to modify PRD to reflect the changes made by AI. This helps in maintaining an up-to-date documentation of the project.We will modify the original Project Overview document, we need to ensure that all changes are accurately captured and communicated.

## 1. Teach AI the project

Its important to provide AI with a comprehensive understanding of the project. This includes:

- **Project Overview**: A high-level description of the project, its goals, and its intended audience.
- **Project Structure**: An outline of the project's architecture, including key components and their relationships.
- **Technologies Used**: Information about the programming languages, frameworks, and tools used in the project.
- **Rules and Guidelines**: Any specific coding standards, conventions, where use/save user components and etc or best practices that should be followed.

We store these file in the project repository, ensuring that AI uses them in every prompt. This helps maintain consistency and clarity in the AI's understanding of the project.

### Example Prompts

```markdown
Create a "project_overview.md" file to describe the structure of this project. Specifically, detailing the folder structure, the purpose of each folder, and any important files that should be highlighted. For now you learning the repository structure, so do not create any files yet, is most important focus.
```

```markdown
Explore the entire repository to understand the codebase from multiple angles: as a software architect, a software engineer, and a product manager. I want you to compile your findings into a comprehensive Markdown document in the root directory of the repository. For describing technical concepts, you should use the Mermaid diagrams in this Markdown document.
```

We gonna set AI for example Copilot to use these files in every prompt.

## 2. Analyze Steps Required for the Task

We ask AI to analyze the steps required for the task at hand. This involves breaking down the task into smaller, manageable components and identifying the necessary actions to complete each component. We create a product requirements document (PRD) to help AI understand the project.

### Example Prompts

```markdown
Create a product requirements document (PRD) for the [...feature description...] feature. [Some details about the feature and its requirements]. For now, work out the PRD and don't code yet.
```

```markdown
I want you to act as a product manager and create a product requirements document (PRD) for the [...feature description...] feature. [Some details about the feature and its requirements]. Do not code yet; instead, deeply think about which requirements we need and how [the feature will be implemented] in details. PRD markdown file.
```

We gonna store them in root of the project like `prds/000-feature_name.md`.

## `3. Prompt AI to Code

Once AI has a clear understanding of the project and the requirements, we can prompt it to generate code. This step involves providing specific instructions and context to ensure that the generated code aligns with the project's goals and standards.

### Example Prompts

```markdown
Fully implement this PRD.
```

## 4. Review and Iterate

After the initial code generation, it's important to review the output and iterate on it as needed. This may involve refining the prompts, providing additional context, or making adjustments to the generated code to better align with the project's goals. Use Git to manage the codebase and track changes effectively. Ask Ai to use familiar to you packages and libraries.

## 5. Update Documentation

As the code evolves, so too should the documentation. Ensure that any changes made to the codebase are accurately reflected in the project's documentation. This includes updating the PRD, code comments, and any other relevant documentation.

### Example Prompts

```markdown
Update the product requirements document (PRD) to reflect the changes made in the codebase.
```

```markdown
Modify the origin PRD and add a section where you describe how far along the current implementation is.
```

```markdown
Update the project overview document to include the latest changes in the project structure and any new technologies or tools that have been introduced.
```

## Conclusion

Prompt engineering is a crucial skill for anyone working with AI models. By mastering the art of crafting effective prompts, developers can unlock the full potential of these powerful tools.
